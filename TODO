There are a lot of things to do for 7colors:

- Use custom dimension for game table
- Use custom xpms
- Network play
- Add menu
- i18n
- Choose to use or not the Gnome libraries 
- Read the book "GTK+ / Gnome Application developement" :-)
- Write a better Makefile
- More options and game modes
- Split code on different files
- Comment the code in english (only if someone will ask me)
