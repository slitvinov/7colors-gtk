Description
===========

7colors is a game for XWindow, for one or two players, the goal is to
color the 50% (plus one) of the rhombs on the screen, before the other
player does. Each turn the player choose a color, this color propagates
from the own corner (the lower left for player 1, the upper right for
player 2) to all the neighbour rhombs with the same color.


Installation
=============

You need to have installed GTK library, to compile program just run:

$ make

and then copy the executable everywhere you want.


Usage
======

7colors [-1|-2] [c|h]

-1, -2   player 1 or 2
c, h     computer or human

i.e. 7colors -1 c -2 h starts a new game with player 1 computer and player 2
the user.
The default is player 1 human and player 2 computer.
If you want something funny try 7colors -1 c -2 c :-)
